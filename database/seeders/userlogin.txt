Step 5: Create Middleware (Optional but recommended)
Create middleware to manage access based on roles. For instance, an AdminMiddleware and a PolioWorkerMiddleware that will restrict access to certain routes based on user roles.

Step 6: Protect Routes
Use middleware to protect routes. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
Route::get('/admin/dashboard', function () {
    // Only users with the 'admin' role can access this
})->middleware('auth', 'admin');

Route::get('/polio-worker/dashboard', function () {
    // Only users with the 'polio_worker' role can access this
})->middleware('auth', 'polio_worker');
Step 7: User Registration and Login
User registration and login functionalities will be provided by Laravel's generated views and controllers from the authentication scaffolding (make:auth). You can access the registration page at /register and the login page at /login.

Step 8: Assigning Roles
Upon user registration, based on your system's flow, you'll need to assign roles to users accordingly.

Step 9: Testing
Test the registration, login, and role-based access control to ensure they are working as expected.

Make sure to adjust the role definitions and middleware logic as per your application's requirements. Also, consider using database seeders to create initial users with respective roles for testing purposes.

Remember to thoroughly test the user registration, login, and role-based access control to ensure the system is working as intended. If you decide to use a package for roles and permissions, make sure to follow the package's documentation for implementation.
